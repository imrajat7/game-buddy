            <h3>Disputes and Jurisdiction</h3>
            <p>All disputes involving but not limited to rights conferred, compensation, refunds, and other claims will
                be
                resolved through a two-step Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism.
                a. Stage 1: Mediation. In case of a dispute, the matter will first be attempted to be resolved by a sole
                mediator who is a neutral third party and will be selected at the mutual acceptance of a proposed
                mediator
                by both parties. Both parties may raise a name for the sole mediator and in the case both parties accept
                the
                proposed name, the said person shall be appointed as sole mediator. In case the parties are not able to
                reach a consensus within two proposed mediators, the Company reserves the right to decide who the final
                mediator is. The decision of the mediator is not binding on both parties.
                b. Stage 2: Arbitration. In case that mediation does not yield a result suitable or preferred by any one
                of
                the parties, arbitration may follow, the award of which is binding on both parties. The Arbitration
                Board
                shall comprise three members – one appointed by each party and the third member to be nominated by the
                two
                appointed members by mutual consent. Arbitration shall be held at New Delhi, India. The proceedings of
                arbitration shall be in the English language. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on the
                Parties.
                If the dispute cannot be resolved by this two-step Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism, it shall be
                referred to the courts at New Delhi.

            <h3> Miscellaneous Provisions</h3>
            <p>a. Entire Agreement: The terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3 and any additional or different
                terms expressly agreed by Client and Service vendor shall constitute the entire agreement and
                understanding

                communications
                between them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Client and Service vendor shall always remain subject
                to
                the terms of the user Agreement.
                <br> b. Waiver: The failure of either party at any time to require performance of any provision of this
                Agreement in no manner shall affect such party's right at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by
                either party of any breach of this Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more
                instances,
                shall be deemed to be, or construed as, a further or continuing waiver of any other such breach, or a
                waiver
                of any other breach of this Agreement.
                <br> c. Severability: If any provision of this Agreement shall to any extent be held invalid, illegal or
                unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement
                shall
                in no way be affected or impaired thereby and each such provision of this Agreement shall be valid and
                enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. In such a case, this Agreement shall be reformed to
                the
                minimum extent necessary to correct any invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, while preserving to
                the
                maximum extent the rights and commercial expectations of the parties hereto, as expressed herein.</p>
